## Inspiration
Currently, University clubs host events and competitions that provide an opportunity for students to gain accolades and manifest their skills in tangible achievements. These awards provide a medium for students to provide evidence of their skills to prospective employers, yet at present, a received award amounts to nothing but a line on a CV. 

## What it does
With NFTR. we hope to provide a platform that will enhance the importance, validity and recognition for these accolades. Through a fully decentralised platform, we have enabled clubs and other University departments to mint, assign and redistribute NFTs to students so that they can collect and display their achievements and accolades received during their University life, both to other students and prospective employers. 

## How we built it
NFTR. is entirely decentralised on the blockchain. Each user is validated by a Smart Contract linking their public key to their student ID, and each club entity is also implemented as a Smart Contract issued by the University.

## Challenges we ran into
- Creating and validating smart contracts on our back end was in order to develop our API

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Developing and designing the entire front-end on React with Material-UI
- Accommodating minting and issuing of new NFTs

## What we learned

## What's next for NFTR.
Currently, NFTR. accommodates club-based awards issued to students. Allowing individual students to collect tokens displaying a list of their achievements throughout their University life. 
In the future, we hope to accommodate a broader range of tokens for all aspects of University life. We're also currently only servicing The University of Melbourne, but plan to be able to host all universities and education facilities soon.
